Data Preparation Cheat Sheet
1. check datatypes (numeric cols may have non-numeric info that needs to be removed, data types may need to be changed) 
    df.dtypes

2. replace categorical with numeric values - consider replacing empty strings with NaN 
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-convert-categorical-variable-to-numeric-in-pandas/


    df['colname'].unique()
    df['colname'].replace(['uniquevalue1', 'uniquevalue2','uniquevalue3',''],
                        [1,2,3,0], inplace=True)

    OR
    
    dummies = pd.get_dummies(df.colname)
    merged = pd.concat([df,dummies].axis='columns')
    merged.drop('colname',axis='columns')

    OR (example from homework Mod20-Day1-Activity02)

    df['colname'].unique()
    colname_dict = {'uniquevalue1': 1, 'uniquevalue2': 2, 'uniquevalue3': 3}
    df2 = df.replace({'colname': colname_dict})
     note: not sure how this would handle a null

    OR (example from homework Mod20-Day1-Activity03)

    def changeChannel(channel):
        if channel == "uniquevalue1":
            return 1
        if channel == "uniquevalue2":
            return 2
        if channel == "uniquevalue3":
            return 2        
        else:
            return 0 
    df_shopping["Channel"] = df_shopping["Channel"].apply(changeChannel)

3. check for nas, nulls and remove if necessary  (na = NOT A NUMBER)  NOTE: df.isna() == df.isnull()  
    https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html

    df.isna().sum()
    df.dropna() 

    NOTE: This does not detect empty strings.  To detect empty strings search for df['colname']==''
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27159189/find-empty-or-nan-entry-in-pandas-dataframe

4. check for duplicate values and remove if necessary
    https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop_duplicates.html

    df.duplicated().sum()
    df.drop_duplicates(keep='first')  note: keep = 'first' is default


5. drop unnecessary columns 
    https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/ref_df_drop.asp#:~:text=The%20drop()%20method%20removes

    df.drop(columns=['colname'])
    or
    df.drop('colname',axis = 1)
    df.drop('colname',axis = 'columns')

6. standardize dataset so larger numbers don't influence the outcome more
    Scale the data - all columns (example from homework Mod20-Day1-Activity06)
        df_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(df)

    Scale the data - subset of columns (example from homework Mod20-Day1-Activity03)
        from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df_shopping[['Fresh', 'Milk', 'Grocery', 'Frozen', 'Detergents_Paper', 'Delicatessen']])

        If you need to add back a column that wasn't part of the scaling (was already 0,1)

        # A list of the columns from the original DataFrame
        df_shopping.columns

        # Create a DataFrame with the transformed data
        new_df_shopping = pd.DataFrame(scaled_data, columns=df_shopping.columns[1:])
        new_df_shopping['Channel'] = df_shopping['Channel']
        new_df_shopping.head()

## <span style="color:red"> **Background**  </span>

In this assignment, you will put your ETL skills to the test. Many of Amazon's shoppers depend on product reviews to make a purchase. Amazon makes these datasets publicly available. They are quite large and can exceed the capacity of local machines. One dataset alone contains over 1.5 million rows; with over 40 datasets, data analysis can be very demanding on the average local computer. Your first goal will be to perform the ETL process completely in the cloud and upload a DataFrame to an RDS instance. The second goal will be to use PySpark or SQL to perform a statistical analysis of selected data.

This Challenge contains two parts. Part 1 is required. Part 2 is optional but highly recommended to strengthen your new skills.

* Part 1: Extract two Amazon customer review datasets, transform each dataset into four DataFrames, and load the DataFrames into an RDS instance.

* Part 2: Extract two Amazon customer review datasets and use either SQL or PySpark to analyze whether reviews from Amazon's Vine program are trustworthy.

##  <span style="color:orange"> **Before You Begin** </span>
1. Create a new repository for this project called "Big-Data-ETL". Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local Git repository, create two folders, "part-1" and "part-2", corresponding to the two parts. If you are not planning on doing "part-2" then create the "part-1" folder only.

##  <span style="color:yellow"> **Files** </span>

Download the following files to help you get started:

<a href = "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-1/m22/lms/starter/Starter_Code_v1.zip " target = "_blank"> Module 22 Challenge files </a>


##  <span style="color:green">  **Instructions** </span>
###  <span style="color:green">  **Part 1** </span>
1. Upload the part_one_starter_code.ipynb into Google Colab and create a duplicate of this file.

2. Explore the <a href = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt" target = "_blank"> Amazon Reviews </a> datasets and pick two datasets to perform ETL.

3. Rename each part_one_starter_code.ipynb file according to the dataset you are using. For example, if you are going to use the <a href = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz" target = "_blank"> Video Game Reviews </a>  file, rename file, part_one_video_games.ipynb. Repeat the process for the duplicate file you created in Step 2.


### ***Extract the Data***
1. Read in each dataset using the correct header and sep parameters.

2. Get the number of rows in the dataset.

### ***Transform the Data***
For each dataset use the schema.sql file located in the Resources folder of the Starter_Code.zip file to create the four DataFrames as follows:

1. Create the "review_id_df" DataFrame with the appropriate columns and data types.

2. Create the "products_df" DataFrame that drops the duplicates in the "product_id" and "product_title columns.

3. Create the "customers_df" DataFrame that groups the data on the "customer_id" by the number of times a customer reviewed a product.

4. Create the "vine_df" DataFrame that has the "review_id", "star_rating", "helpful_votes", "total_votes", and "vine" columns.

### ***Load the Data into an RDS Instance***

Export each DataFrame into the RDS instance to create four tables for each dataset.

**Note:** This process can take up to 10 minutes for each. Ensure that everything is correct before uploading.

###  <span style="color:green">  **Part 2** </span>

Recall that this part is completely optional; you can complete it as a way to challenge yourself and boost your new skills.

In Amazon's Vine program, reviewers receive free products in exchange for reviews. Amazon has several policies to reduce the bias of its Vine reviewsLinks to an external site..

<img src = 'https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-1/m22/lms/img/vine01.jpg' alt = 'image of vine post' />

But are Vine reviews truly trustworthy? Your task is to investigate whether Vine reviews are free of bias. Use either PySpark or, for an extra challenge, SQL to analyze the data.

* If you choose SQL, first use Spark on Colab to extract and transform the data and then load it into a SQL table on your RDS account. Perform your analysis with SQL queries on RDS.

* While there are no strict requirements for the analysis, consider steps you can take to reduce noisy data, such as filtering for reviews that meet a certain number of helpful votes, total votes, or both.

* Submit a summary of your findings and analysis.


##  <span style="color:blue"> **Requirements** </span>
These requirements are for Part 1 only, as Part 2 is optional.

## <span style="color:indigo"> **Submission**  </span>
* Download your Google Colab notebooks as .ipynb files and upload them into the "part-1" folder of your "Big-Data-ETL" Git repository.

IMPORTANT

    Do not clear the outputs of your .ipynb files, and do not upload notebooks that contain your RDS password and endpoint. Delete these two items before making your notebook public!

* Ensure your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file to explain the ETL project.

* If you are doing "part-2" of this assignment, copy your SQL queries into .sql files and upload them into the "part-2" folder of your "Big-Data-ETL" Git repository.

IMPORTANT

    Remember to closely monitor any AWS resources that you choose to use! Itâ€™s crucial that you clean up and stop, or shut down any AWS resources to avoid accruing additional costs. Please refer to the AWS_cleanup.pdf and the AWS_check_billing.pdf files in the Resources folder of the Starter_Code.zip file. Or, you can download the
<a href = https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/AWS_check_billing.pdf target = _blank > AWS Billing Guide </a>
